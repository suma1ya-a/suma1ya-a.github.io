            <h2>Naomi Ward (Cara Ward's Sister)</h2>
            <p>Naomi originally told the police that Sal had been hanging out with her and her friends at time of the time, giving Sal an alibi. However, she later dropped the claim. Why would she do that?</p>

                <h2>Max Hastings</h2>
                <p>Max also corroborated Naomi's claim, later dropping. It is alleged that he had a fling with Andie.</p>

                <h2>Strange notes?</h2>
                <p>Upon starting her investigation, Pip begins recieving mysterious notes, threatening to 'stop digging'. Who is this person? And how are they related to the case? </p>

                <h2>Becca Bell (Andie's Sister)</h2>
                <p>Becca tells Pip to drop her investigation, certain Sal murdered her sister. She warns Pip to 'stop digging' which sounds very similar to the notes she has been recieving.</p>
